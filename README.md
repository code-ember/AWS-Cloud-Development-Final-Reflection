## AWS Cloud Development - Final Reflection

### Experiences and Strengths:
This challenging yet rewarding course has pushed me to grow as a software developer. I have gained valuable skills in cloud development, including containerization and serverless architecture with AWS, which will benefit my future career. Learning full stack development and working with AWS features has deepened my understanding of cloud computing platforms and API gateways. This class emphasized the importance of mastering full stack development for a successful software development career. Constructive feedback from the course has further enhanced my programming skills.

The class has familiarized me with building and maintaining REST APIs through AWS, crucial for deploying web applications. I've also learned to create websites with databases that connect to API gateways.

My eagerness to learn new skills and technologies is my greatest strength, helping me stay ahead. I can identify software requirements and use creativity and problem-solving skills to find optimal solutions. Being a team player with strong communication abilities is another key strength.

I am prepared to take on various tasks and challenges in a new job, understanding the roles a computer scientist might encounter. Everything learned in this class has prepared me for different roles and given me the skills to use AWS services for my journey as a full stack developer.

### Planning for Growth:
Scaling and error handling are significant advantages of microservices. Scaling a web application involves configuring and applying AWS auto-scaling, which helps mitigate error handling issues.

To manage cloud service costs, I would use AWS Cost Explorer to optimize expenses. Containers and serverless computing offer predictable costs compared to virtual servers, with serverless being more cost-effective by charging only for used resources. I prefer a serverless approach for its cost savings.

When planning for expansion, pros include higher revenue and better positioning for future success, while cons involve time and logistical challenges. Elasticity is crucial in decision-making for planned growth, ensuring the application has necessary resources to meet demand. The pay-for-service model is simple, beneficial when using limited resources.
